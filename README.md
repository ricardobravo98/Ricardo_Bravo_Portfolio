Here are the main results of our midbootcamp project, which consists of **the implementation of a regression model**.

May we explain a little bit what this is about. 

**Scenario**

We are working as analysts for a real estate company. Our company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

**Objective**

Our job is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

**Expected Outcomes**

Since this is a regression model, you can use linear regression for building a model. You are also encouraged to use other models in your project including KNN regressor, decision trees for regression.

**1. Explore the data**
To explore the data, you can use the techniques that have been discussed in class. Some of them include using the describe method, checking null values, using Matplotlib and Seaborn for developing visualizations.

The data has many categorical and numerical variables. Explore the nature of data for these variables before you start with the data cleaning process and then data pre-processing (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables).

**2. Build a Model**
Use different models to compare the accuracies and find the model that best fits your data. You can use the measures of accuracies that have been discussed in class. Please note that while comparing different models, make sure you use the same measure of accuracy as a benchmark.

**3. Visualize**
You will use Tableau to visually explore the data further.
